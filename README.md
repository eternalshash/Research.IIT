# Leveraging AI Models to Predict Gene Expression from Gut Microbiome Profiles in Colorectal Cancer

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict intestinal function based on gut bacteria, with a particular focus on patients with Colorectal Cancer. Our approach aims to enhance the predictive accuracy of CRC-related gene activity, ultimately contributing to early diagnosis and targeted treatment strategies.

## Project Description

### Background Information and Problem Statement

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer worldwide, with significant links between the gut microbiome and tumor development. Emerging research has revealed that variations in the gut microbiome are not only associated with CRC but also play a crucial role in modulating host gene expression, particularly in immune and inflammatory pathways
Prior studies have largely focused on understanding the influence of the microbiome within isolated disease contexts. However, our study aims to explore the deeper relationship between bacterial species and gene expression specifically in CRC patients

### Objectives and Scientific Hypothesis
The primary goal is to develop an AI/ML model to predict the impact of different bacterial and gene occurance within a patient to predict the likelyhood of CRC within a patient 

### Methodology and Approach

#### Data Collection and Analysis
- Utilize RNA sequencing data and bacterial species abundance data from IBD patient samples.

#### Initial Modeling
- Identify gene expression changes relevant to drug absorption and metabolism, correlating these changes with bacterial species prevalence.

#### Advanced Analytical Techniques
- Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify key bacterial components impacting gene pathways.

#### Model Development and Testing
- Construct and refine AI/ML models, including regression models and neural networks, to accurately predict bacterial impacts on drug absorption and metabolism.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Data**
   - Analyze the given multi-dimensional spreadsheet data to understand variability and gene expression changes.
   - Go through all the data and understand what is needed and what isn't
   - Make basic models and start rigorous documentation protocols

2. **Implementing Regression Model (Part 1)**
   - Create a preliminary clustering and association-based model using supervised learning techniques.

3. **Implementing ML Model (Part 2)**
   - Develop a Neural Network based on existing data, transitioning to unsupervised learning to refine the model.

4. **Network Testing**
   - Compare the performance of Dependency-based Convolutional Neural Networks (D-CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for the dataset.

5. **Scalability**
   - Evaluate the scalability of both RNN and D-CNN approaches for large-scale data.

6. **Model Creation and Verification**
   - Develop, optimize, and verify the model over a three-semester cycle, culminating in an integrated and clinically relevant predictive model.

### Timeline

1. **Summer Semester**
   - Preliminary testing and development of a basic regression and clustering model.
   - Implementation of D-CNN to handle structured data and test scalability.

2. **First Semester of Armour Research Cycle**
   - Focus on data cleaning, preprocessing, and creating a baseline for model performance.
   - Begin optimization phase for both RNN and D-CNN models.

3. **Second Semester of Armour Research Cycle**
   - Final testing and model validation.
   - Integration of RNN and D-CNN models and iterative feedback loop for continuous learning.

## Expected Contributions and Impact

The project aims to advance cancer diagnostics by leveraging AI to predict gene expression from microbiome profiles, potentially enabling earlier CRC detection. By integrating diverse datasets, the model can improve accuracy, leading to personalized treatment strategies. The development of an API will facilitate real-world testing, allowing for broader clinical application. Ultimately, this research could enhance our understanding of the gut microbiomeâ€™s role in cancer.

## Progress Showcase

The progress of this project will be showcased at the Armour R&D Expo and potentially at the Chicago Area Undergraduate Research Symposium (CAURS).
