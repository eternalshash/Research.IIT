# basics of arithmetic in python!

# June 15th 

# float(s) string(s) Int(s)

# Example float or floating point number: 10.6
# Example for a integer: 10 

# We have different of operations in python for math 

# Addition: 10 + 5 
# Subtraction: 10 - 5 
# Multiplication: 10 * 5 -> in python we will use *(shift + 8) for multiplication  
# Division: 10 / 5 -> the slash will indicate divison
# Modolus: 10 % 3 -> 1 -> so we have the %(shift + 5) to find the remainder 

# Exponents, logarithmic , .... 


numberList = [19, 76, 89, 796, 2, 10]

# We want to make a calculator using these numbers 
# Example: 
# INPUT
# Pick your first number: 89
# Pick your second number: 76
# What operation would you like to perform: Subtract
# 89 - 76 = 13
# Output is 13

# Every spot in a list/array is called a index 
# [19, 76, 89, 796, 2, 10] -> falls at index 3
#  0   1   2   3
# We know that the legnth of the array = index of the array + 1

# List of length 4
# List Index would be 3 
print(numberList[3])

numberPick1 = int(input("What is index of your first number ")) # Asks the user
numberPick2 = int(input("What is index of your second number ")) # Asks the user

operationPick = input("What operation would you like to perform: ")

print("You chose:", numberList[numberPick1], operationPick, numberList[numberPick2])

if(operationPick == '+'): # What does if mean ??? -> if the condition in the () is true than do what comes after
    print( numberList[numberPick1] + numberList[numberPick2])

# answer 89 - 86 , its 13















if(operationPick == '*'): 
    print( numberList[numberPick1] * numberList[numberPick2])
    
if(operationPick == '/'): # What does if mean ??? -> if the condition in the () is true than do what comes after
    print( numberList[numberPick1] / numberList[numberPick2])
